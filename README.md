# Facial Expressions Recognition with CNN and OpenCV

# Project Video : [Facial Expression Recognition](https://youtu.be/zLqIbR-Fc2I)


## Introduction

This project aims to detect facial expressions in real-time using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and OpenCV. It includes a trained CNN model that was generated using the "CNN_model.py" script, and a script to perform facial expressions recognition in real-time named "FER_main_test.py".

### Getting Started

To run the facial expressions recognition program, follow these steps:

1 . Install the required dependencies:
* Python 3.6 or higher
* OpenCV 4.5 or higher
* NumPy 1.19 or higher
* Keras 2.4 or higher
* TensorFlow 2.4 or higher

2 . Download or clone the repository to your local machine.

3 . Navigate to the project directory using a terminal or command prompt.

4 . Run the following command to start the program:

```
python FER_main_test.py
```


5 . The program will start the camera and show a live video stream with a rectangle around the detected faces and the predicted facial expressions.

### Customization

If you wish to train your own CNN model, you can modify the "CNN_model.py" script to generate a new model. You can also customize the pre-processing steps by modifying the "pre-processing.py" script to fit your dataset.
